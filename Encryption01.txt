This is my SuperSecret ASCII crypt facility. 
Encryption is not something I've spent much time on, but what I have here might suffice for any envisaged Encryption requirement.
Following the tradition of having an INPUT and an OUTPUT file, my AES implementation via Openssl does the job well enough I am tempted to believe although the physical security of the stored and/or transmitted Data of course is as important as the complex scrambling of the messages and text.
Not going in for a double or triple encode, the Bash script saves to file straight away without the facility to just display decrypted material to screen. I did have it doing this, but due to lack of use or impetus their's no implementation in the prog. 
I don't, if ever compile progs., because of lack of necessity and also the freqency of alterations just makes it an annoying extra step.
Clearly no room for any error is accounted for here and the fact is the user is trusted in every way making this a non-starter for general implementation.

bash script files then.


Ncrypt.sh

#!/bin/bash
clear
echo
echo "File to Encrypt   - " 
read C1
echo "Name of Crypted file - " 
read C2
openssl aes-256-cbc -e -in $C1 -out $C2 -k "Literacy12345" -nosalt -a
echo
cat $C2


Dcrypt.sh

#!/bin/bash
clear
echo
echo "File to Decrypt   - "
read D1
echo "Filename for Text -"
read D2
openssl aes-256-cbc -d -in $D1 -out $D2 -k "Literacy12345" -nosalt -a
echo 
cat $D2
