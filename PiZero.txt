First Project for me. I could add photos.

Raspberry Pi Zero 2WH 
3 projects on the one device
Camera, Morse Code LED, ASCII LED Transmit.

1. Legacy RaspBi coding works the camera.
2. Python code flashes Morse code to the LED 
3. A Python program translates and transmits ASCII implementation on 8 LED's.
