First Project for me. I could add photos.

Raspberry Pi Zero 2WH 
3 projects on the one device
Camera, Morse Code LED, ASCII LED Transmit.

1. Legacy RaspBi coding works the camera.
2. Python code flashes Morse code to the LED 
3. A Python program translates and transmits ASCII implementation on 8 LED's.

Python file then (mostly written by MS Edge AI) - ASCII_3.py

    for pin in led_pins:

            GPIO.output(pin, GPIO.HIGH)
        else:

    setup_gpio()
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:

                transmit_ascii_code(ascii_code)
                time.sleep(1)  # Delay for 1 second
                for pin in led_pins:
                    GPIO.output(pin, GPIO.LOW)
                time.sleep(.25)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass
    finally:
        GPIO.cleanup()
